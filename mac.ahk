; This script assumes that Alt and Ctrl characters have been swapped using a third-party tool (for Example: Windows PowerToys)

; -----KEY GUIDE-----
; # Win. (the key with the Windows logo) therefore `Send #e` would hold down Win and then press E.
; + Shift. For example, `Send, +abC` would send the text "AbC", and `Send, !+a` would press Alt+Shift+A.
; ^ Alt (because of remapkey). For example, `Send, This is text!a` would send the keys "This is text" and then press Alt+A. Note: !A produces a different effect in some programs than !a. This is because !A presses Alt+Shift+A and !a presses Alt+A. If in doubt, use lowercase.
; ! Ctrl (because of remapkey). For example, `Send, ^!a` would press Ctrl+Alt+A, and Send, ^{Home} would send Ctrl+Home. Note: ^A produces a different effect in some programs than ^a. This is because ^A presses Ctrl+Shift+A and ^a presses Ctrl+A. If in doubt, use lowercase.Sends Ctrl. For example, Send, ^!a would press Ctrl+Alt+A, and Send, ^{Home} would send Ctrl+Home. Note: ^A produces a different effect in some programs than ^a. This is because ^A presses Ctrl+Shift+A and ^a presses Ctrl+A. If in doubt, use lowercase.
; & An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey.
